Engine\_cudamrg is a cryptographic engine that can accelerate some operation using a CUDA supported device, we currently support the following cipher types:

  * AES-128-ECB
  * AES-128-CBC
  * AES-192-ECB
  * AES-192-CBC
  * AES-256-ECB
  * AES-256-CBC

We support both encryption and decryption for theese cipher types.

For future releases we plan to optimize currently supported cipher types, add more cipher types and digest algorithms.

You can find detailed instruction on installation, configuration, usage and a performance analysis into the wiki.

Feel free to report any bug or suggestion to the mailing list or through the issue tracker.

If you want to test it or use it please let me known your opinion through the mailing list or directly to my email address, same way if someone want to join the development team or help me to improve or translate the documentation in other languages different from those currently supported (English and Italian).
